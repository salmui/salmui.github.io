        Seeking a career opportunity as a Front-End Web Developer. My goal is to
        find a fast-growing company where I can bring my passion for development
        to life and learn along the way! Nothing is more gratifying than seeing
        visual mocks come to life.

        I currently work for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. as a Associate Web Merchant. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I
        have been heavy involved in front-end work and content related pieces. I am
        hands on with weekly projects including
        reusable code used across our site teams, rich content pages, useful
        guides, and weekly homepage flips. Languages and frameworks used include
        Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Our CMS platform is bootstrapped across
        desktop and mobile browsers.
