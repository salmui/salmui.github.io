        Seeking a career opportunity as a Front-End Web Developer. My goal is to
        find a fast-growing company where I can bring my passion for development
        to life and learn along the way! Nothing is more gratifying than seeing
        visual mocks come to life.
      </p>

      <p>
        I currently work for Williams-Sonoma, Inc. as a Site Merchandise Analyst
        / Jr. Front-End Web Developer. Since the beginning of the pandemic, I
        have been doing a hybrid role as a Jr. Front-End Developer. I am pretty
        hands on with the development side and have weekly projects including
        reusable code used across our site teams, rich content pages, useful
        guides, and weekly homepage flips. Languages and frameworks used include
        Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Our CMS platform is bootstrapped across
        desktop and mobile browsers.
      </p>

        Born and raised in the Bay Area. I graduated from UC Davis with a
        bachelors in Managerial Economics and completed my Full Stack Web
        Development certification in 2017. My interests include hiking, going to
        the gym (powerlifting), and outdoor adventures. I am a huge foodie and
        have a strong love for breakfast/brunch foods.
